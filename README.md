# zookeeper-live
A web program to monitor nodes on zookeeper

This project is not yet completed, I just started coding on it recently. Here I also invite passionate and earnest programmers to join in my project, especially in webpage programming. Welcome to contact me via email: zpf.073@gmail.com or QQ: 510428177.

This program is designed to monitor and manage zookeeper. Zookeeper is an open source software used to store useful information like common variables, service status etc. and usually zookeeper is configued in cluster mode. While it's important to monitor zookeeper cluster, we may be more interested in the nodes information on zookeeper. This software is born after I found no apt web tools with such functionality on internet.

I intend to add the following functionalities to zookeeper-live:

1. start, shutdown and restart zookeeper server.
2. query and update of nodes on zookeeper.
3. dynamically config alarm priority on each node.
